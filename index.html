                <strong>Global Administrators cannot search for or access files in Microsoft Teams beyond their own
                    permissions.</strong>
                The Teams interface shows them exactly what any regular user would see — only their own files and files
                shared with them.
                Any access to other files requires separate administrative tools that leave complete audit trails.

                <p>
                    Global Administrators are responsible for managing the health, security, and access across Microsoft
                    365. Their role includes powerful tools — but all of this work is done in the <strong>back
                        end</strong>
                    (admin centers and tools), not through the usual front-end applications like Teams or Outlook:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Configure security and access settings</strong><br>
                        (They manage who has access to what, including roles, licenses, and policies.)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reset passwords and unlock accounts</strong><br>
                        (Helping staff regain access to their accounts — though not intended for data access.)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Run organisation-wide reports and dashboards</strong><br>
                        (They can monitor system usage, security, and compliance through built-in tools.)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set up new apps and services</strong><br>
                        (Admins can deploy Teams, SharePoint, or Exchange for the organisation.)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Support investigations when authorised</strong><br>
                        (They can run searches or access files, but only through official tools with full logging.)

                    Despite their high-level role, Global Administrators <strong>do not have automatic access</strong>
                    to everyone's files or private content. Like all users, they are bound by Microsoft 365's security
                    rules:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>They cannot read private Teams chats or messages</strong><br>
                        (Private chats are protected unless accessed through legal/compliance tools.)

                    <li><strong>They cannot bypass file permissions through the Teams interface</strong><br>
                        (Even with full admin rights, they're still blocked unless access is explicitly granted.)

                <p>
                    The <strong>Front End</strong> is what people see and use every day — it's where Global Admins
                    behave exactly like regular users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Back End</strong> is where Global Admins actually work: setting permissions, managing
                    licenses, and keeping everything secure.
                </p>
                <p class="analogy">
                    <em>Think of it like the difference between living in a house (front end) and being the building

                    files

                    <h3>Global Administrator</h3>
                    <p>The highest level of administrative access in Microsoft 365. Can manage all aspects of the
                        organisation's Microsoft 365 environment, but still follows permission-based restrictions
                        for

                    <p>Electronic discovery - a legal process for finding, collecting, and producing electronic
                        information for legal cases. In Microsoft 365, this is done through specialized tools that
                        search across all content while maintaining legal compliance.</p>

                        what,
                        when, where, and how. This log cannot be modified or deleted by administrators and serves as

                    <p>A security model where users can only access files and content they have been explicitly
                        given
                        permission to see. Even administrators must follow these rules unless they use special

                        refers to administrative tools and interfaces where Global Admins actually manage the
                        system.</p>
