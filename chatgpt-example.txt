This is a question that was aked of chat gpt when logged out therefore the model used must have been 3.5.

Can we use this as an example on the chat GPT page to demonstrate how to do a "bad" chatgpt interaction and why this is bad and how we could have made it a good one. Can we also explain why the results cannot be trusted please.

In a Microsoft Purview search, if it says a file was accessed, what does that mean?

In Microsoft Purview, if a file is shown as "accessed" in an audit or content search, it typically means that someone interacted with the file in a way that reads or opens it. Specifically, "accessed" can refer to:

Common actions that count as "access":
• Opening a file in SharePoint, OneDrive, or Teams (e.g., viewing a Word document or Excel file).
• Previewing a file in the browser or within Microsoft 365.
• Downloading the file, which triggers a read action.
• Syncing a file via OneDrive (automatic or manu kne that reads file contents).
• Using the file in an app (e.g., embedded file in a Teams message that is viewed).
• Sharing a link and then someone using that link to view the file.


Actions that do not necessarily count as "access":
• Merely seeing the file listed in a folder (no preview or open).
• Hovering over a link or file name.
• Being granted permissions (but not using them).
• Indexing by Microsoft search (sometimes excluded, but can be context-dependent).
