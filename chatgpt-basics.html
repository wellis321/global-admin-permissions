                <strong>ChatGPT-3.5 is trained only on data before January 2022 and will "guess" about current
                    events.</strong>

                capabilities.

                <h2>Microsoft Documentation and ChatGPT-3.5: Critical Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important Fact:</strong> ChatGPT-3.5 has NO access to official Microsoft Azure
                    documentation.
                    This is not a gap in knowledge - it's a complete absence of authoritative Microsoft documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Many users assume ChatGPT knows everything about Microsoft
                    products, but ChatGPT-3.5 has zero knowledge of official Microsoft documentation due to licensing
                    and
                    partnership timing.

                <p class="analogy">
                    <em>Think of it like asking someone who's never read the official instruction manual for a complex
