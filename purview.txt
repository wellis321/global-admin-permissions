I want to create a clear, single-page website that helps people understand how to read a Microsoft Purview audit report — especially when it shows that a user has "Accessed file" entries.

The page should:

Explain in plain language what "Accessed file" means

Describe why it appears (e.g. system searches, previews, background scans)

Clarify the difference between system access and user actions (like opening or downloading)

Show how to interpret IP addresses, such as Microsoft service IPs vs. user IPs

Address GDPR implications and data routing (e.g. files accessed via Microsoft servers outside the EU)

Emphasize that "Accessed file" ≠ proof that someone opened the file

Include a FAQ section to handle common questions like:

"Did the user open the file?"

"Why are there only 10 rows when I saw more files?"

"What does SharePointFileOperation mean?"

"Is this a GDPR problem?"

Bonus features (optional):

A visual example of a Purview row with explanations for each column

A downloadable PDF summary for compliance teams

A glossary of key terms (e.g., Activity, Operation, ClientIP)

The tone should be calm, factual, and reassuring, suitable for internal IT, compliance, or legal teams trying to understand what Purview reports do and don’t show.
