for chatGPT these are the things we want information on:

That the 3.5 model is trained on data only up to the year 2021

What it means for a Large language Model to be trained on data.

That if you dont have a OpenAI account meaning you wont have access to chat GPT 4 or the most latest version which has access to making "web-calls" or asking questions of the internet and current documents and data as oppossed to the 3.5 version.

The concept of halucinations and how the 3.5 version is essentially "guessing" when it doesnt have the current up to date correct information like the chat GPT 4 would.

The importance of well structured and designed prompts and questions to get back good quality answers that can be trusted.
