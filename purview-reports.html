            <p>
                <strong>"Accessed file" in Purview reports does not mean someone opened or downloaded the file.</strong>
                It often indicates system-level activities like background scans, indexing, or automated processes.
                Understanding the difference between system access and user actions is crucial for accurate
                interpretation.

                <p>
                    When you see "Accessed file" entries in Microsoft Purview reports, it's important to understand what
                    this activity represents:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        analysis.)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Preview generation</strong><br>
                        (Automatic creation of file previews for SharePoint, Teams, or OneDrive interfaces.)

                    <li><strong>Compliance scanning</strong><br>
                        (Automated checks for data classification, retention policies, or regulatory compliance.)

                    <li><strong>Backup and synchronization</strong><br>

                    <li><strong>Someone opened the file</strong><br>

                            A: Not necessarily. "Accessed file" often means system-level access for indexing, scanning,
                            or preview generation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Q: Why are there only 10 rows when I saw more files?</strong><br>
                            A: Purview reports may be filtered or limited. Check your date range, user filters, and
                            activity types.</li>
                        <li><strong>Q: What does SharePointFileOperation mean?</strong><br>
                            A: This indicates a SharePoint-specific operation, often automated system processes like

                            A: Generally no. System access is covered by data processing agreements and serves
                            legitimate business purposes.</li>

                            A: Yes, you can filter by user (exclude system@ accounts) or by specific activity types.

                            A: Audit logs are typically retained for 90 days to 1 year, depending on your Microsoft 365
                            license.</li>

                <h3 class="icon-lightbulb">Key Points to Remember</h3>
                <p><strong>System vs User:</strong> Always distinguish between automated system processes and actual
                    user actions when interpreting audit logs.</p>
                <p><strong>Context Matters:</strong> Consider the IP address, user account, and client application to
                    understand the nature of the activity.</p>
                <p><strong>Normal Operation:</strong> System access is a normal part of Microsoft 365 functionality and
                    doesn't indicate unauthorized access.</p>

                        file." The type of activity helps determine if it was user-initiated or system-generated.</p>
